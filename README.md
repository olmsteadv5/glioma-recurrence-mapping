# Brain tumour segmentation on UPenn-GBM

Segments glioma MRI with the BraTS competition algorithms, then works out which
Yale Brain Atlas parcels the tumour sits in and which white matter tracts run
through it. Opens a 3D view at the end.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Docker has to be running and you need to be in the docker group. FreeSurfer and
ITK-SNAP also need to be installed, for mri_synthstrip and greedy.

## Running it

```bash
./main.py 36 42 51
```

The numbers are UPenn-GBM subject numbers, anything from 1 to 630. It downloads
the scans, skull-strips them, segments, registers into atlas space, works out
the parcel overlap, and opens a browser view for each one.

About 3 minutes a subject on CPU. The first run is a lot slower because it
pulls a 30 GB Docker image and 60 MB of atlas data, both of which are kept.

Everything else reruns every time, so if you only want to look at a subject you
have already done, don't rerun the pipeline. Just open the view:

```bash
./view.py 36
```

Every parcel the tumour touches gets drawn. The legend is the main control:
tumour tissue classes first, then the tracts, then the grey shell, then the
parcels in order of involvement, so the things you care about are not buried.
Click any entry to toggle it.

Along the bottom are the things the legend cannot do: a slider for shell
opacity, a dropdown to show or hide all the parcels at once, and a dropdown to
switch the parcel colouring.

Two palettes. The atlas's own colours parcels by region, so neighbours often
look identical, only 75 distinct colours across 696 parcels. The other is
YBA_696_Freeview_HighContrast.txt, where no two touching parcels share a
colour, which is much easier to read when a tumour spans a dozen of them.

From Python, `view.run` also takes `top=20` if you only want the most involved
parcels, `shell_opacity` for the shell's starting transparency, and `palette`
to pick which colouring it opens with.

## Where things end up

```
inputs/<SUBJECT>/     the raw scans, never touched after download
inputs/atlas/         Yale Brain Atlas data
outputs/<SUBJECT>/    stripped scans, segmentation, registration
outputs/results.json  volumes, Dice, parcel overlap
```

Both directories are gitignored. Everything in them can be regenerated.

## Files

```
main.py        runs the whole thing
fetch.py       download scans
skullstrip.py  SynthStrip
verify.py      input checks
segment.py     BraTS in Docker
evaluate.py    volumes and Dice
register.py    SRI24 to MNI152
atlas.py       atlas volume, meshes, parcel overlap
tracts.py      tract centrelines
view.py        3D view, also runnable on its own
paths.py       shared paths
```

## Worth knowing

If you have an NVIDIA GPU it uses BraTS25_1, which won the 2025 challenge. On
CPU it falls back to BraTS25_2 and says so. Nothing to configure either way.

main.py has a shebang pointing at .venv, so ./main.py works without activating
anything. Fix that line if you move the project.
